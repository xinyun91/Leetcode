 #Data Structure:
 
    HashSet (able to detect duplicates)
    
 #Analyze:
 
    Solution here has high space complexity,
    but the idea is straight forward,
    check respectively for rows, columns and 9sub-boxes,
    check if element is not '.', add it to hashset if it does not exist,
    else the sudoku is invalid
